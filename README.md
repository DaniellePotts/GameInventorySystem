# Game Inventory System

My 2nd year Software Development Assignment for University, which aims to demonstrate a number of capabilities and understandings, including (from what I remember):
- OO design and integration
- inhertance and polymorphism
- interfaces
- collection usage
- serialization

Project is a simple game inventory system that includes features:

- allows user to create a player with default values
- lets user search for new items
- lets user equip items
- lets user buy and sell items in a shop
- lets user save their player

System is not a full game, just an inventory - with potential to be extended in the future... when I get time! 

Assignment included minor documentation and diagrams including a UML (which I can no longer find) :)

Assignment mark: 100%
